Description of my project Multithreaded Chat Application using Java Sockets :This project is a real-time client-server chat application developed in Java. It demonstrates how socket programming and multithreading can be used together to enable communication between multiple clients connected to a single server.
The server manages client connections, while each client can send and receive messages instantly. Messages sent by one client are broadcast to all connected clients, creating a group chat system.
